# Azure Landing Zone for Fabric Capacity Management Solution

## Overview
This document outlines the recommended Azure Landing Zone design for deploying and managing Fabric Capacities across an enterprise environment. The design follows Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and Well-Architected Framework principles.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Management Groups Structure
```
Root Management Group
├── Platform
│   ├── Connectivity
│   ├── Identity
│   └── Management
└── Landing Zones
    ├── Production
    │   └── Fabric-Production
    └── Non-Production
        └── Fabric-Development
```

### 2. Subscription Design
- **Platform Subscription**: Houses shared services and management components
  - Network resources (Hub VNet)
  - Security services
  - Monitoring solutions
- **Fabric Production Subscription**: Production Fabric capacities
- **Fabric Development Subscription**: Non-production Fabric capacities

### 3. Resource Organization
```
Platform Subscription
├── rg-platform-networking-prod
├── rg-platform-security-prod
└── rg-platform-monitoring-prod

Fabric Production Subscription
├── rg-fabric-prod-eastus
└── rg-fabric-prod-westus

Fabric Development Subscription
├── rg-fabric-dev-eastus
└── rg-fabric-dev-westus
```

## Security Controls

### 1. Identity and Access Management
- Use Azure AD for identity management
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Custom roles for Fabric Capacity management
- Just-In-Time (JIT) access for administrative tasks

### 2. Policy Framework
```
Management Group Level Policies:
├── Allowed Regions
├── Mandatory Tags
├── Resource Naming Convention
└── Fabric-Specific Policies
    ├── SKU Restrictions
    ├── Capacity Creation Controls
    └── Admin Access Requirements
```

### 3. Network Security
- Hub-Spoke network topology
- Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- Azure Firewall for network traffic control
- Private Endpoints for secure connectivity

## Monitoring and Governance

### 1. Monitoring Setup
- Azure Monitor for resource metrics
- Log Analytics Workspace for centralized logging
- Application Insights for application monitoring
- Activity Logs for audit trail

### 2. Cost Management
- Resource tagging strategy
- Budget alerts
- Cost allocation by department
- Regular cost optimization reviews

### 3. Compliance
- Regular compliance assessments
- Automated policy compliance checks
- Regular security posture reviews

## Automation and DevOps

### 1. Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform templates for infrastructure deployment
- GitHub Actions for automation
- Policy-as-Code implementation
- Configuration management

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
```
Pipeline Components:
├── Source Control (GitHub)
├── Infrastructure Pipeline
│   ├── Policy Deployment
│   ├── Resource Group Creation
│   └── Fabric Capacity Deployment
└── Monitoring Pipeline
    ├── Alert Rules
    └── Dashboard Deployment
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Resource Naming Convention
```
<resource-type>-<workload>-<environment>-<region>-<instance>

Examples:
- fab-analytics-prod-eastus-001
- fab-reporting-dev-westus-001
```

### 2. Tagging Strategy
```json
Required Tags:
{
    "Environment": ["prod", "dev", "test"],
    "Department": "<department-name>",
    "CostCenter": "<cost-center-code>",
    "Owner": "<team-email>",
    "Project": "<project-name>"
}
```

### 3. Security Recommendations
- Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Implement least privilege access
- Regular security assessments
- Automated compliance checks

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Management Group hierarchy setup
2. Core networking infrastructure
3. Basic policy implementation
4. Identity and access management

### Phase 2: Security and Governance
1. Advanced security controls
2. Monitoring and logging
3. Cost management
4. Compliance framework

### Phase 3: Automation
1. IaC implementation
2. CI/CD pipeline setup
3. Automated provisioning
4. Policy automation

### Phase 4: Operations
1. Operating model implementation
2. Support process setup
3. Documentation
4. Training and handover

## Success Metrics
- Policy compliance rate
- Resource provisioning time
- Cost optimization achievements
- Security posture improvements
- Operational efficiency metrics

## Next Steps
1. Review and customize the landing zone design
2. Create implementation timeline
3. Define success criteria
4. Begin phased implementation
5. Regular review and optimization
